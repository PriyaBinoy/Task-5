# Task-5
Wireshark Packet Capture

 Overview

This task involved using Wireshark to capture live network traffic, identify different protocols, and analyze sample packets. The capture was saved and analyzed to better understand how data flows across a network.

 Steps Performed

Installed Wireshark with Npcap support.

Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).

Captured traffic for about 1 minute while browsing websites and using commands like ping and nslookup.

Saved the capture as task5_capture.pcapng.

Used Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy to identify protocols.

Chose three protocols (TCP, TLS, ARP) and analyzed example packets.

Answered basic theory questions from the task sheet.

 Protocols Observed

TCP → Connection setup and reliable data transfer.

TLS → Secure encrypted HTTPS communication.

ARP → Address resolution on the local network.

 Conclusion

This task demonstrated how to:

Capture and save network packets.

Identify and filter protocols in Wireshark.

Analyze key packets like TCP handshakes, TLS handshakes, and ARP requests.

Wireshark is a powerful tool for learning, troubleshooting, and analyzing network communication at the packet level.
